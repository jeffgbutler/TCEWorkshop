# Setting up to run Jupyter Notebooks

This repo contains several Jupyter notebooks that can run commands. Currently they only work on Linux/MacOS machines. Here's how to set it up:

```shell
pip3 install ipykernel
pip3 install bash_kernel
pip3 install jupyter
python3 -m bash_kernel install
```

VScode setup: Install Python and Jupyter extensions from Microsoft
